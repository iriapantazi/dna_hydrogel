 here there is python3 code for 
 creating the plots of pairs formed 
 vs time (converted in tau) and 
 then averaging for the last 100 steps
 to plot the melting curves with error 
 bars.



further amendments:

1. variable inputs: tau, num_atoms in the system 
2. the input info to be read from the input file
3.
4.
